    "description": "In the flexible job shop scheduling problem with changeover, each job consists of an ordered sequence of operations that must be processed on compatible machines. The processing time of an operation depends on the chosen machine. Additionally, when two consecutive operations in a job are processed on different machines, a machine-dependent changeover time must be observed between them. The objective is to minimize the makespan, i.e., the time when all jobs are completed.",
